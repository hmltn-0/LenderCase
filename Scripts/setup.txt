1. Create an account at https://platform.openai.com/signup/
2. Navigate to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and create a new secret key with the following settings:

   - Name: Optional (you can leave this blank or give it a descriptive name)
   - Project: Default project
   - Permissions: Choose 'All' to allow full access
3. Copy the generated API key.

Best practices for storing your API key:
   - For long-term projects, it's recommended to use a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault.
   - For simplicity, you can create a  file in your project directory with the following content:
       OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   - Make sure to add the  file to your  to avoid exposing your API key in version control.

4. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' in the text_extraction_script.py with your actual OpenAI API key or set it as the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY.
5. Install the required Python packages by running:
   pip install openai PyPDF2
6. Specify the path to the PDF file in the script and run it using:
   python Scripts/text_extraction_script.py

Setup Instructions:
1. Create an account at https://platform.openai.com/signup/
2. Navigate to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and create a new secret key with the following settings:
   - Owned by: You
   - Name: Optional (you can leave this blank or give it a descriptive name)
   - Project: Default project
   - Permissions: Choose 'All' to allow full access
3. Copy the generated API key.

Best practices for storing your API key:
   - For long-term projects, use a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault.
   - For simplicity, create a file named ".env" in your project directory with the content:
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   - Add the ".env" file to your ".gitignore" to avoid exposing your API key in version control.

4. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' in the text_extraction_script.py with your actual OpenAI API key or set it as the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY.

5. Test the API key by running:
   bash Scripts/test_api_key.sh

6. Ensure ability to make API calls:
a. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview
b. Confirm you have a valid payment method and no overdue balances
c. Run the test script:
   bash Scripts/test_api_call.sh

7. Install required Python packages:
   pip install openai PyPDF2

8. Specify the PDF file path in the script and run:
   python Scripts/text_extraction_script.py

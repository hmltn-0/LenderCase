Setup Instructions:

1. Create an account at https://platform.openai.com/signup/
2. Navigate to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and create a new secret key with the following settings:
   - Owned by: You
   - Name: Optional (you can leave this blank or give it a descriptive name)
   - Project: Default project
   - Permissions: Choose 'All' to allow full access
3. Copy the generated API key.

Best practices for storing your API key:
   - For long-term projects, it's recommended to use a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault.
   - For simplicity, you can create a file named ".env" in your project directory with the following content:
       OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   - Make sure to add the ".env" file to your ".gitignore" file to avoid exposing your API key in version control.

4. Test the API key by running the provided test script using:
   bash Scripts/test_api_key.sh
   This will ensure the API key is valid and list available engines.

5. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' in the text_extraction_script.py with your actual OpenAI API key or set it as the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY.
6. Install the required Python packages by running:
   pip install openai PyPDF2
7. Specify the path to the PDF file in the script and run it using:
   python Scripts/text_extraction_script.py
